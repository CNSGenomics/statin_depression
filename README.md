# statin_depression

The scripts in this repository were used in the analyses presented in https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.27.22273017v2

More specifically, scripts used to compare the CMap gene expression signatures of statins and antidepressants can be found in ./CMap_analysis. The ./SMR_analysis/ directory contains scripts used to perform MR analysis (using the SMR tool), to infer causal association between statin target genes and various outcomes (including depression risk, depressive symptoms, and immune/haematologicla traits)
